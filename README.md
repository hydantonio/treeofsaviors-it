# ToS Italian Community (Hosted by ForumFree) 
Tree of Savior Italia is a community that aims to help all Italian Players of TOS. We all are working and contribuiting to develop a proper Translation of one of the most anticipated game of the 2015 year.
The project of the Italian Translation has been begun 28th Feb. 2016 by the Administrator and supported the entire community.

> Currently the Translators have no idea if the translation will be directly used in-game or not, we will try to communicate with the Staff of the Tree of Savior Developers Team and sort news out.
