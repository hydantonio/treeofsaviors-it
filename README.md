# About the Italian Translation
Tree of Saviors (https://treeofsavior.com/) is a MMORPG that is developed by the korean development studio imcGames. The lead developer Kim Hakkyu was also the creator of Ragnarok Online and developed it until he left Gravity due to arguments.
At the moment the Italian Translation (IT - Language) is developed just by a couple of members, but any help or other is always welcome!

> Currently the Translators have no idea if the translation will be directly used in-game or not, we will try to communicate with the Staff of the Tree of Savior Developers Team and sort news out.
> For any update, please always refer to Readme.md file.
